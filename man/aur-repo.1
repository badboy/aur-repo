.SH "FOLDER STRUCTURE"
\fBaur\-repo\fR needs just two folders for its work\. By default these are \fI/build\fR and \fI/packages\fR\.
.
.P
The build directory holds the config file (see \fICONFIGURATION FILE\fR), a log file and the build folders of each package\.
.

The package directory holds the repository database as well as the binary packages\. If you want to use the repository you need to serve this directory over \fIhttp\fR\.
.
.P
Both directories can be overriden by an environment variable\.
.
.P
\fBBUILDDIR\fR defaults to \fI/build\fR, \fBPACKAGEDIR\fR defaults to \fI/packages\fR\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
The \fBaur\-repo\fR looks for a file called \fIrepo\.conf\fR located in the \fBBUILDDIR\fR\. The default \fBBUILDDIR\fR is \fI/build\fR\. You can overwrite this with an environment variable\.
.
.P
The file format is as easy as:
.

.nf

REPONAME=my\-repo
GET_FROM_AUR=(
  package1=a
